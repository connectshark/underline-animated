This project uses a background color to achieve the gradient underline effect, which adds a gradient line composed of multiple colors below the text.

The implementation method uses the CSS "background-image" property to set an image containing a gradient color as the background of the element. The "background-size" and "background-position" properties are used to control the size and position of the image, so that it overlaps with the text underline.

In addition, the "transition" property of CSS is also used to create a moving effect when the mouse hovers over the background image, thus enhancing the visual effect of the underline.

This project is inspired by Kevin Powell's YouTube video.
